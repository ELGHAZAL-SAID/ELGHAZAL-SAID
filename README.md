### Hi there 👋

------
I'm a 23-year-old junior Django developer from Morocco with a 3-year degree in Computer Science. 

I love using code to automate boring repetitive tasks. I'm always exploring new technologies and tools to enhance my skills, and I appreciate the power of open-source software as a Linux user.

Let's collaborate on projects that challenge and inspire us to create innovative solutions.
